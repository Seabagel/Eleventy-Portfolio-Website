Although Nutritional Facts tell us how much fat and calories is in the food, It doesn't tell us the density of nutrients and carbs inside</p><h2>Nutritional Facts</h2><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/food-labels-fat-cholesterol/">Food Labels explained</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/foods-to-increase-hdl">LDL and HDL Cholesterol</a></li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Generally, you want to limit Fat, Cholesterol, and Sodium; and increase Fiber, Vitamins, Calcium, and iron</li><li>A <code>%DV</code> is the amount of recommended percentage of your daily total intake<ul><li>above 20% is considered high, while DV below 5% is low</li></ul></li><li><code>Carbs</code>, <code>Protein</code>, and <code>Fat</code> are the 3 main components when it come to your body's nutrients. Each of them gives you calories, and they provide different needs<ul><li><strong>Carbs</strong> is made from complex sugars. It's slower to break down than basic sugars, but provide more energy. Carbs gets stored and converted as fat, when your body has an excess.</li><li><strong>Protein</strong> is used for building muscles in your body. It comes from meat, eggs, beans, and fish. Dairy products also contain protein</li><li><strong>Fat</strong> is your body's extra energy. It doesn't get used until the body used up all the available calories.</li></ul></li><li>Another factor in nutrients is <code>Cholesterol</code>.<ul><li>Cholesterol is another word for, <em>"The fat inside your blood vesels"</em></li><li>Fat builds up on walls inside your bloodstream, and restrict blood flow</li><li>Your body has to work harder to pump blood, if it's blocked by cholesterol.<ul><li>This can lead to heart disease and other complications</li></ul></li><li>There are 2 kinds of cholesterol. <code>LDL</code>, and <code>HDL</code><ul><li><strong>LDL</strong> is bad cholesterol. it's short for <em>Low-Density Lipoproteins</em></li><li><strong>HDL</strong> is good cholesterol. having HDL in your system helps reduce LDL.<ul><li>HDL attaches to LDL, and carries them along with it, as it travels your blood stream</li><li>One way of losing bad cholesterol is by <code>excercising</code> 30 minutes/day</li><li>and another way is by eating <code>Oatmeal</code> at least 1 cup/day</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Losing Weight Strategy</h2><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1w7_sg3nKw">3 Stages - How to lose Belly fat</a></li><li><strong>BMR</strong> is the number of calories your body uses to maintain vital functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and brain function</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>There's a misconception that your body always uses 2000 calories per day<ul><li>This depends on what activity you're doing. You might be using 500 calories a day, if you're just sitting down with no movement; far less than standing work</li><li>You can increase your daily Calorie requirement (<em><strong>BMR</strong></em>), by doing Cardio excercises</li></ul></li><li>If you're above 15% of body fat, the best thing to lose weight is <code>Calorie Deficit</code><ul><li>This basically means <em>"Eating less than what your body uses"</em>. Eat less carbs and fat.</li><li>As you eat less, your stomach shrinks, and reduce the feeling of hunger.</li><li>Just because you limit your calorie, doesn't mean you don't eat carbs.<ul><li>Eating <code>Low Calorie Density</code> foods can fill you up, without gaining a lot of calories</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Combine this with doing Cardio excercise, your body can use more calories, while reducing the calorie intake, therefore using the stored fat</li></ul><h2>Below 15% Body Fat</h2><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4xwZuIAZJM">Lose 100 pounds in one year</a></li></ul></blockquote><p>When you're finally at 15% or below, you need to replace the different strategy to lose weight</p><ul><li>Reduce fat, as much as possible, below the daily recommended</li><li>Replace fat intake with carbs, so you have the energy to create muscle,</li><li>Also have as much protein to help your body build muscle</li><li>The reason is, your body is trying to protect fat from burning, since it's an emergency source of energy.<ul><li>When your body doesn't use fat or carbs, it starts to eat away your muscles</li><li>This is wouldn't affect people above 15% body fat</li></ul></li><li>Not every part of your body will lose fat equally<ul><li>Fat prioritizes <em>first</em>: your Arm, Face, Shoulder, Chest, and then your Belly</li></ul></li></ul></section></main><footer></footer></div></body></html>
